Great work converting from integers to Strings.  And you even included the sort :-)

There's a little bit of funky indenting in getMax and getMaxIndex and getMin and getMinIndex.
Doesn't affect the functionality, of course, but it catches the eye, like a misspilld word in a sentence.  
Something to be conscious of.

Good work - 10/10
